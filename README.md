# Azure Trusted Research Environment

Across the health industry, be it a pharmaceutical company interrogating clinical trial results, or a public health provider analyzing electronic health records, there is the need to enable researchers, analysts, and developers to work with sensitive data sets.

Trusted Research Environments (TREs) enforce a secure boundary around distinct workspaces to enable information governance controls to be enforced. Each workspace is accessible by a set of authorized users, prevents the exfiltration of sensitive data, and has access to one or more datasets provided by the data platform.

Workspaces can be configured with a variety of tools to enable tasks such as the development of machine learning models, data engineering, data analysis, and software development. Authorized users should be able to deploy and configure their tools without a dependency on IT teams.

A successful Trusted Research Environments enables users to be as productive, if not more productive than they would be working in environments without strict information governance controls.

## Project Status

This project is currently in development. The aim is to bring together learnings from past customer engagements where TREs have been built into a single reference solution.  It is unlikely that the solution will be deployed "as is", but rather taken by customer, partner, and Microsoft engineering teams and extended to meet an organizations specific requirements.

It is important before deployment of the solution that the [Support Policy](SUPPORT.md) is read and understood.
