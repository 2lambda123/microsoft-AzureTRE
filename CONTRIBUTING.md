# How to contribute to Azure TRE

First of all thank you. Azure TRE is a collective effort to make it easier to create and manage trusted research environment.

## **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/microsoft/AzureTRE/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/microsoft/AzureTRE/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
* Before submitting, please double check on the current coding conventions used.

## **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Open a [new feature issue](https://github.com/microsoft/AzureTRE/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature&template=feature_request.md&title=) so we can first discuss the changes there. After the discussion you may send a PR with relevant changes. Do not send a PR without discussion on an issue.

## **Do you want to contribute to Azure TRE?**

* Great, please create an issue were the community can discuss the change. Then fork the repository, make your change and then create a PR. Make sure the solution is tested and provide steps on how to test the change in the PR.

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
