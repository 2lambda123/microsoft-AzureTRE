# Azure TRE base workspace

The base workspace template is the foundation that all other workspaces and workspace services are built upon. Alternative workspace architectures could be used. However, the templates provided in this repository rely on the specific architecture of this base workspace.

The base workspace template contains the following resources:

- Virtual Network
- Storage Account
- Key Vault
- VNet Peer to Core VNet
- Network Security Group
- App Service Plan

## Azure Trusted Services
*Azure Trusted Services* are allowed to connect to both the key vault and storage account provsioned within the workspace. If this is undesirable additonal resources without this setting configured can be deployed.
